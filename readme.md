# Visualizing Machine Learning
### How to build an interactive Plotly dashboard for your classification model

This repository involves building a simple K-Nearest Neighbors classifier using the Iris dataset and scikit learn, and then visualizing the results with [Plotly Dash](https://plot.ly/dash). The lecture is intended for students with some introductory knowledge of data science (i.e., you understand simple classification and can read a confusion matrix).

* You can view the finished app [here](https://knn-iris-classifier.herokuapp.com/).
* Watch me explain how to build this app during a 1-hour [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/tcF4XPAq7rE).  
* Take a moment to read my [Medium post about deploying Dash apps](https://medium.com/@austinlasseter/how-to-deploy-a-simple-plotly-dash-app-to-heroku-622a2216eb73).
* I also have a gallery of simple Dash apps for learning [here](https://github.com/austinlasseter/plotly_dash_tutorial/blob/master/06%20Heroku%20examples/list%20of%20resources.md).
* If you'd like to learn even more about Plotly Dash, check out my [tutorial repo](https://github.com/austinlasseter/plotly_dash_tutorial) on github!.
* Reminder - the `assets` folder contains a file called `favicon.ico` -- you can find and download customized favicons [here](https://www.favicon.cc/). Just replace the current favicon with a new one!
* Note that Plotly dash apps are best viewed in a modern browser like Mozilla or Chrome.
