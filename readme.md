## Example dashboard

* This repo demonstrates how to visualize a simple ML model using [Plotly Dash](https://plot.ly/dash).
* You can view the finished app on heroku [here](https://knn-iris-classifier.herokuapp.com/).
* Additional materials can be found [here](https://github.com/austinlasseter/plotly_dash_tutorial/blob/master/06%20Heroku%20examples/list%20of%20resources.md).
* Plotly dash apps are best viewed in a modern browser like Mozilla or Chrome.
* The `assets` folder contains a file called `favicon.ico` -- you can find and download customized favicons [here](https://www.favicon.cc/). Just replace the current favicon with a new one.
